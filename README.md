<h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm Patryk </h1>

I'm a self-taught frontend developer with a strong foundation in React and a relentless drive to continue growing my skills in the field. Passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites, I take pride in delivering high-quality results. As an effective and productive professional, I thrive in a fast-paced environment and consistently meet deadlines. As a quick learner and a self-motivated individual, I am always eager to take on new challenges.

I highly value constructive criticism as it helps me refine my skills and deliver even better results. 

Now, I'm actively seeking more permanent employment opportunities, rather than project-based work. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to bring your projects to life
